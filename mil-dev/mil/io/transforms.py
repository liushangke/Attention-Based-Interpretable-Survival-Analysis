    Flattened and structured datasets have variable dimensions that change with

    that are ragged along these variable dimensions. This function performs
    this ragged transformation and sets shapes to ensure compatibility with keras
    models. A ragged batched dataset is returned.
    Parameters
    ----------
    dense_dataset : tf.data.Dataset
        An unbatched dataset of dense tensors and labels.
    D : int
        The number of features per instance. This is used to define shape[-1]
        of the tensors in dense_dataset. The shape setting operations cannot
        infer this at runtime in graph mode, so it must be provided.
    devices : int
        The number of devices to use in parallel training. Required for batching.
    structured : bool
        Flag indicating whether to read features in structured (True)
        or flattened (False) format. Default value is False.
    Returns
    -------
    parallel_dataset : tf.data.Dataset

    -----
